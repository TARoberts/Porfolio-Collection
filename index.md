### Design Work, before University.
This section contains a small amount of homebrew content I created to fill what I percieved as gaps in the currently available archetypes for 5th edition D&D between 2015 & 2018. These prototypes went through several revisions but unfortunately at the time I was unable to gather enough testing data to see whether they were fun enough to release. had I managed to test the classes I had, there was intention to release them onto the DM's guild as a package.

### Post Graduation Personal Projects

The following documents are sample Game Design Documents for the sorts of projects I would like to pursue in the future

### First Year Work

[Demo video due to the repo being made unable to be forked and the repo being made private by UWE Bristol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTmZxZgWoII&list=PLsT8UXjJti2k84J1OuAp-ilb48WAyA5gV&index=6)

For the final submission for one of my first year modules, I worked as a part of a team with other course members to create a simple 2d game in a simple custom engine (PyASGE). For this project I co-ordinated our team's efforts whilst working on the level design, levle implementation, collision, the base menus,  and supplement A* pathfinding via manually creating the matricies which determined which tiles were available for players and NPCs to walk on.

Once again in first year, we were tasked with creating the concept and demo for a simple mobile game. The majority of the focus for this was on the game design documents required to be created which I unfortunately no long have access to but for this project I worked on all the programming aspects of the game whilst my partner created all of the art assets and helped design the world. This game is not available to play, as there is basically no gameplay and there was no repo at the time due to myself being the only one to work on the programming side of the project. The primary focus of this project was the design aspect. The first notion was to create a musical comedy style game where different genres of music were represented. I decided to implement simple gameplay features which simulated playing musical intstruments which would then emulate rhythm games, such as tapping the screen to simulate percussion and swipe motions to simulate string instruments. 

Finally in first year I was given several C++ tasks, focussing on using SFML to recreate iconic games. This collection of games marked the first time I had to make choices between realism and game feel with regards to physics. For Pong & Breakout, consistent and accurate physics were required to balance gameplay. However, for Angry Birds, adjustments were made to angles and gravity to create a better feeling game. All of these projects were created by myself alone with the aid of online tutorials and lecturers. Unfortunately the repos are unavailable at present due to restrictions from UWE Bristol due to the learning materials in use. 

### Second Year Work

During second year, the focus of projects moved from purely code based to applying greater focus to tools based development and further replication and understanding of pre-existing systems in games. For one of my modules, we were given 4 systems to choose from to attempt to recreate. I chose to attempt to recreate some of the systems from Control, with regards to the telekinesis elements of gameplay. This project was designed to enusre a greater understanding of game engine mechanics and as such heavily involved looking at others work to take inspiration from and try to emulate.

Also during second year I was able to focus more on my prefered aspect of development, that being level design and gameplay programming. I was introduced to level design along side Unreal 4 at this time, using Blueprints to create the following simple level and gameplay, merging the work from recreating telekinesis in the previous examples to create a platforming experience merged with a puzzle aspect. For this project all of the design aspects were created using creative commons textures and all of the programming and development was created by myself. The level was required to have a flyby camera, moving platforms, and puzzles. I took inspiration from older games for the dark lighting and the player control schemes but aimed more into modern game design and built upon systems imported from the Control project to introduce complicated platforming puzzles The end product was an extremely challenging puzzle platformer which intentionally had replay value, giving players optional shortcuts that are not immediately obvious along with a building block puzzle that stumped many players the first time.

Following on from this we were tasked with creating several gameplay features in Unity which cumulated in the creation of a short gameplay demo made in random teams where in all of our combined work should have been used to plug in together, showing how we had created sturdy independant systems which were easily transferable. This did not work as intended as one of my group members was very poor with their communications and performed a large merge which broke the final demo on the day of submission. However, the individual tasks and the effort put in to implement everything together formed the basis of my dissertation and made me much more asstertive when chasing up people to merge their work in the future. This project had a strict brief with the only creative expression coming from the choice of animations available and the world assets for the final level.

As a part of direct C++ one of the first tasks of the year was to emulate the gameplay of the original Super Mario games. During the process creative expression was allowed to differentiate from the original slightly in feel and display.

The final group project for the same module had us design and create a bespoke local multiplayer game. For this project we once again worked in the custom ASGE library. The full details on my part in the game are outlined in the attached video. I handled asset sourcing, audio, level design, class implementation, collision and state management for the game loop. The game was inspired from several online Asymetrical PVP games but especially Space Station 13 and Amoung Us. In the collection of sound assets it was important to stay on theme and not distract the player from either the minigames or escaping The Bear.

The final and personally most important work I did in second year was the full design and creation of a board game. For this group project I was team leader as a result of being the lead designer for the game. I took the prompt of modern social issues and decided to create a game based on balancing life when you work from home versus when you are working in an office environment. For this, players take the role of students who have the option to attend lectures and other such classes in person or online. The game does not provide any strict benefits or drawbacks to either as research shows that there is no clear better choice to make, it is entirely dependant on the personal circumstances of the individual in question. For this game, we performed a vast amount of testing and iterative design and ended up creating a game that had almost exclusively good feedback on the actual gameplay and implementation of the themes. This project solidified my desire to work as much in the physical gaming space as much as the digital. To design this game involved drawing on my life experience and that of my teammates. It was extremely satisfying to accurately portray student life in the wake of Lockdown and still duringg the Covid 19 pandemic, without directly referencing it.

### Third Year Work

For my dissertation I looked at Difficulty In Action RPGs. This is a topic closed to my heart, as they are my favourite kind of video game and having the oppertunity to examine the evolution over time of difficulty in all video games was very enjoyable. The final project aspect was the creation of an extremely simple action RPG boss battle. Ultimately this scope of the project had pivoted over time resulting in a less satisfying final project, but the information I gathered and detailed was extremely useful in deepening my understanding of challenge as a part of video games as a whole. The design was intended to emulated Monster Hunter and Dark Souls but as a person with strong ADHD and many other responsiblities the final product fell a bit flat. The role that animation and art play in those games is an entirely under represented factor in the difficulty and spectacle of the titles and while the concept behind my difficulty managementt system would have upscaled, without those external factors it became clear that I was not going to produce anything near that level.

During my final year we were also once again presented with the oppertunity to undertake several different smaller projects as a part of getting to grips with modern technology and development techiques in video games. I chose to create two of these systems in Unity and one of them in Unreal 5, as it had just become available to use for university work. The following video breaks down each task and shows a quick demonstration. Each task had roughly five weeks of development time, with two dedicated days a week for feedback and long coding sessions. All of these proejcts were solo work.

Procedural generation was the first task attempted and combined several different tutorials to generate the world, then the buildings before finally combining the two and changing the spawning of the buildings to be less random and adhere to sets of rules to create a realisitic looking modern city. Ultimately I think this was successful and allowed me to implmement city generation rules which created visually pleasing cities and could well be scaled up until the file size becomes unmanagable. 

[Procedural City Generation](https://github.com/TARoberts/AT_Procedural_City)

Mesh Destruction was the most technically challenging project due to the way in which unity handles mapping UVs and converting between object space and real space. A tutorial was followed to get basic random mesh slicing
which was then built upon to allow users to control the slicing and to improve performance. For this project, pre-generated destruction techniques were disallowed such as those built into Unity. This project was successful and wanted to emulate games such as Fruit Ninja.

The final mini project  was set by a different lecturer to the first and required a demonstration and understanding of level streaming. I chose to do this in unreal 5 as the tools available were better and I wanted a chance to get to grips with a different engine. Unfortunately due to issues with the version of visual studio I had installed, I was forced to only use blueprints and pre-built tooks to acheive these effects. However, I did manage to understand the limits and benefits of level streaming regardless. This project taught me a lot of methods of loading in obscured areas in a practical way so as to best use system memory and not overwhelm older PCs with sheer number of assets. The experience in Unreal 5 was also great and only soured by having 5 different visual studio versions on my PC causing conflicts at every opportunity.

Collection of Game Jams done throughout third year.

For the Commercial Games Development model at UWE, we were required to split in to pseudo-random teams and develop several games from conception to playable in the form of Game Jams. For the majority of these projects I was once again team lead and lead designer whilst also managing bug fixes and co-ordinating development. 

The first game was to be an Atari 2600 version of a modern game, with the game itself having to focus around "Flow". For this, we decided to demake Splatoon. On this project I handled the game loop and menus, along with sourcing and managing audio & visual assets. I also programmed the game audio and did bug fixing and polish.  Sadly this project was made private and contact was lost with the creator of the repo. The style and general design were limited to be very pixelated and only use 2 bit audio which provided a fun challenge and resulted in having to hand make all the assets to match the colours and tone. 

Our second game was designed to run on the bare minimum of modern specs (no dedicated GPU, 3 gigabytes of RAM) but had to be a 3d game this time. For this, we attempted to make a horror adventure game based on Thief and Dishonoured. In this project I once again handled menus, the game loop, scoring, game design, and audio with some minor roles in bug fixing, player abilities and art asset management. We were provided with world building assets and requred a low detail model so we went with a smoke monster design that was optimised to work with our dark fog effect to limit player vision and reduce rendering load. I also decided for us to make it a replayable single level where you permanently unlocked abilities each time you played which would give you defensive abilities and unlock extra areas of the map. 

This game only works with a controller!

The final games jam we undertook was as a part of the global games jam under the theme of "Roots" for this we had to focus on the quality of the experience, making the gameplay loop as smooth as possible and creating a plesant user experience. For this project I once again worked on the implementation of menus and audio and this time I also worked on the gameplay feel of moving the on screen sprite (which I also created). This is a simple mobile style game where you have to dodge hazards to complete the stage. I immediately concepted this game once the jam theme was announced and once again focussed on replayabilty of a single level due to the two day time limit. The project could have been expanded to a larger scale over time with ease, as the obstacles were manually generated to ensure the level was possible to complete.

For this project, the entire year group was put into a studio environment where we had to take one of the group's projects and expand it into a full local split screen multiplayer game. We opted to create a 2v2 PvP game where players had to steal treasure from a vault. For this, I once again lead my team who were focussed on gameplay for the players. We worked on the player controller, some level design, audio and implementation of other gameplay features such as scoring and power-ups. I personally sourced almost all of the audio files in the game whilst managing my groups' contributions and co-ordinating with other teams to understand their wants and needs from the player controller I also designed several final changes to the levels and implemented the background music manager for all scenes. Once the controller was locked in we moved to assisting in billboarding the level and bug testing/fixing.
