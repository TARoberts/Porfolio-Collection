### Design Work, before University.
This section contains a small amount of homebrew content I created to fill what I percieved as gaps in the currently available archetypes for 5th edition D&D between 2015 & 2018. These prototypes went through several revisions but unfortunately at the time I was unable to gather enough testing data to see whether they were fun enough to release. had I managed to test the classes I had, there was intention to release them onto the DM's guild as a package.

### First Year Work

For the final submission for one of my first year modules, I worked as a part of a team with other course members to create a simple 2d game in a simple custom engine (PyASGE). For this project I co-ordinated our team's efforts whilst working on the level design, the actual creation of the levels in engine, collision and attempted to aid with A* pathfinding via manually creating the matricies which determined which tiles were available for players and NPCs to walk on.

Once again in first year, we were tasked with creating the concept and demo for a simple mobile game. The majority of the focus for this was on the game design documents required to be created which I unfortunately no long have access to but for this project I worked on all the programming aspects of the game whilst my partner created all of the art assets and helped design the world. This game is not available to play, as there is basically no gameplay and there was no repo at the time due to myself being the only one to work on the programming side of the project. 

Finally in first year I was given several C++ tasks, focussing on using SFML to recreate iconic games. This collection of games marked the first time I had to make choices between realism and "game feel" with regards to physics. For Pong & Breakout, consistent and accurate "physics" were required to balance gameplay. However, for Angry Birds, adjustments were made to angles and "gravity" to create a better feeling game. All of these projects were created by myself alone with the aid of online tutorials and lecturers. Unfortunately the repos are unavailable at present due to restrictions from UWE Bristol. 

### Second Year Work

During second year, the focus of projects moved from purely code based to applying greater focus to tools based development and further replication and understanding of pre-existing systems in games. For one of my modules, we were given 4 systems to choose from to attempt to recreate. I chose to attempt to recreate some of the systems from Control, with regards to the telekinesis elements of gameplay. Much of these were created based on work done by others which I then refeactored and expanded upon to create the final demonstration environments.

Also during second year I was able to focus more on my prefered aspect of development, that being level design and gameplay programming. I was introduced to level design along side Unreal 4 at this time, using Blueprints to create the following simple level and gameplay, merging the work from recreating telekinesis in the previous examples to create a platforming experience merged with a puzzle aspect. For this project all of the design aspects were created using creative commons textures and all of the programming and development was created by myself.

Following on from this we were tasked with creating several gameplay features in Unity which cumulated in the creation of a short gameplay demo made in random teams where in all of our combined work should have been used to plug in together, showing how we had created sturdy independant systems which were easily transferable. This did not work as intended as one of my group members was very poor with their communications and performed a large merge which broke the final demo on the day of submission. However, the individual tasks and the effort put in to implement everything together formed the basis of my dissertation and made me much more asstertive when chasing up people to merge their work in the future.

During second year we were also still focussed on good practise and development in C++. The first "welcome back" task we were given was to use a bespoke custom library (ASGE) to recreate mario level 1-1. This was a very quick task.

The final group project for the same module had us design and create a bespoke local multiplayer game. For this project we once again worked in the custom ASGE library. The full details on my part in the game are outlined in the attached video. I handled asset sourcing, audio, level design, class implementation, collision and state management for the game loop.

The final and personally most important work I did in second year was the full design and creation of a board game. For this group project I was team leader as a result of being the lead designer for the game. I took the prompt of modern social issues and decided to create a game based on balancing life when you work from home versus when you are working in an office environment. For this, players take the role of students who have the option to attend lectures and other such classes in person or online. The game does not provide any strict benefits or drawbacks to either as research shows that there is no clear better choice to make, it is entirely dependant on the personal circumstances of the individual in question. For this game, we performed a vast amount of testing and iterative design and ended up creating a game that had almost exclusively good feedback on the actual gameplay and implementation of the themes.
